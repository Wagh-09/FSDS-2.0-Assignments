    "#### 2.What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans:- In programming, a string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text. It is typically enclosed in quotation marks and can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a named storage location in a program's memory that is used to hold a value.\n",
    "Variables can be used to store values of different data types, such as numbers, strings, and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between a string and a variable is that a string is a fixed value, while the value stored in a variable can be changed. \n",
    "For example, you could define a string with the value \"Hello World\" and it would always be \"Hello World\", \n",
    "but you could define a variable and assign it the value \"Hello World\" at one point in your program, and then later assign it a different value, such as a number or a different string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that strings are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified once they have been created.\n",
    "In contrast, the value stored in a variable can be changed as many times as necessary throughout the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for declaring a variable in python \n",
    "Variable names can only contain letters, digits, and underscores. They cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, x and X are different variables.\n",
    "You cannot use any of the Python keywords as variable names. \n",
    "It is a good practice to give variables descriptive names. This makes your co"

    "#### 8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans:- In Python, variable names can only contain letters, digits, and underscores. They cannot start with a digit.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, 100 is not a valid variable name because it starts with a digit.\n",

    "The reason for this rule is that Python uses certain digits and symbols to represent special meanings (such as the equal sign (=) for assignment). \n",

    "#### 9.What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Ans:- In Python, you can use the following three functions to convert a value to a specific data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 int(): This function converts a value to an integer data type. If the value is a floating-point number, it will be truncated (not rounded) to an integer. \n",
    "If the value is a string, it must contain a valid integer representation.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "int(3.14)  # 3\n",
    "int('10')  # 10\n",
    "int('3.14')  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3.14'\n",
    "\n",
    "2 float(): This function converts a value to a floating-point number data type. If the value is an integer, it will be converted to a floating-point number. \n",
    "If the value is a string, it must contain a valid floating-point number representation.\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "float(3)  # 3.0\n",
    "float('3.14')  # 3.14\n",
    "float('hello')  # ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "3 str(): This function converts a value to a string data type. If the value is a number, it will be converted to a string representation of that number.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "str(3)  # '3'\n",
    "str(3.14)  # '3.14'\n",
    "str(True)  # 'True'\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these functions, you can easily convert a value to the desired data type in Python. \n",
