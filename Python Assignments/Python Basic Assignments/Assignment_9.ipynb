    "#### 1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "Ans:- The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD). For example: if Absolute path to a file called test.txt is: C:/users/admin/docs/test.txt If my PWD is C:/users/admin/ , then the relative path to stuff.txt would be: docs/test.txt Note: PWD + relative path = absolute path"
